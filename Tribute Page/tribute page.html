      <h2 class="text-left">There are some quotes by Albert Einstein</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Imagination is more important than knowledge.</p>
        <p>The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing.</p>
        <p>Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new.</p>
        <p>Try not to become a man of success, but rather try to become a man of value.</p>
